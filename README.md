## Week 3 - Password Generator

For this weeks HW, I created a password generator using javascript. The user is presented with various prompts regarding which characters to use, as well as password length.

After the user successfully answers all prompts, the generated password is displayed on the HTML page.

I used various different array methods and if statements, as well as various window methods such as confirm and prompt.
